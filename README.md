# cve-analysis
Tools for conducting analysis of CVE data in Elasticsearch

## Quick Start:

cd into the docker directory. Then run
`docker-compose up`

This will take a while to run as all the NVD data is downloaded and loaded
into Elasticsearch.

You should be able to access Kibana on
http://localhost:5601

This also loads a basic dashboard into Kibana

## Less Quick Start
Download Elasticsearch and Kibana from elastic.co
You will need version 7 or above

Start them (basically ./bin/elasticsearch and ./bin/kibana from the
respective directories).

Run `get-cve-json.sh` to download the CVE data from NVD  
Run `update-es.sh` to import the CVE data into Elasticsearch

You rerun the above commands to update your data whenever needed.

Now navigate your web browser to http://localhost:5601

The script honors two environment variables
ESURL which should be your Elasticsearch URL. For example

```
export ESURL='https://username:password@somehost:9200'
```

And the ESCERT which you should point at the ca.crt generated by
Elasticsearch if TLS is enabled (which it is in 8.0 and above)

```
export ESCERT=/some/path/certs/ca/ca.crt
```
