# cve-analysis
Tools for conducting analysis of CVE data in Elasticsearch

## Slow Start
Download Elasticsearch and Kibana from elastic.co

Start them (basically ./bin/elasticsearch and ./bin/kibana from the
respective directories).

Run `get-nvd-json.sh` to download the CVE data from NVD
Run `json-parse.py nvd-out.json` to import the CVE data into Elasticsearch

You rerun the above commands to update your data whenever needed.

The script honors two environment variables
ESURL which should be your Elasticsearch URL. For example

```
export ESURL='https://username:password@somehost:9200'
```

And the ESCERT which you should point at the ca.crt generated by
Elasticsearch if TLS is enabled (which it is in 8.0 and above)

```
export ESCERT=/some/path/certs/ca/ca.crt
```
