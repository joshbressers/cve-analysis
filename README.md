# cve-analysis
Tools for conducting analysis of CVE data in Elasticsearch

## Quckstart:
Download Elasticsearch and Kibana from elastic.co
You will need verison 7 or above

Start them (basically ./bin/elasticsearch and ./bin/kibana from the
respective directories).

Run `get-cve-json.sh` to download the CVE data from NVD  
Run `update-es.sh` to import the CVE data into Elasticsearch

You rerun the above commands to update your data whenever needed.

Now navigate your web browser to http://localhost:5601

Now go to the Management area. Click "Saved Objects". In the upper right of the
screen you'll see "Import". Import the cve-kibana.ndjson file.

Now you should have some basic visualizations and a dashboard to look at.
Happy hunting.

The script honors two environment variables
ESURL which should be your Elasticsearch URL. For example

```
export ESURL='https://username:password@somehost:9200'
```

And the ESCERT which you should point at the ca.crt generated by
Elasticsearch if TLS is enbaled (which it is in 8.0 and above)

```
export ESCERT=/some/path/certs/ca/ca.crt
```
